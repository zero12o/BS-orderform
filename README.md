# BS-orderform
A bootstrap order form that I have created on bootstrap 3.3.2

<h3>Why you ask?</h3> 
Cause its cool and awesome and maybe you can help me a bit to make it more awesome. For now its very simple. I want to make it dynamic one day but for now the only dynamic thing about it is the password field.
