# BS-orderform
A bootstrap order form that I have created on bootstrap 3.3.2

<h3>Why you ask?</h3> 
Cause its cool and awesome and maybe you can help me a bit to make it more awesome. For now its very simple. I want to make it dynamic one day but for now the only dynamic thing about it is the password field. 

V 1.0.0
This version I have removed the fonts folder for bootstrap and opted to use font awesome cdn for the gylph icons instead as it provides more options that I like and CDN support. 

I have re-done the bootstrap theme css as I learned that nested css is better than individual classes.

I am push more of a HTML 5 framework than before so I made some changes to the index file. I have now added article as the main content holder and footer for well footer stuff.
